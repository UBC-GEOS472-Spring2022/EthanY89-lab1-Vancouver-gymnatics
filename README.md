Reflective analysis: The goal of my map is to provide an overall of the location of gymnastics within the western Vancouver area(westside of 99 highway).  The aimed reader of the map is people who are planning to visit Vancouver and people who are new to Vancouver and willing to find a place to work out and train. In my perspective, I think this particular map is helpful to provide a general overall of the gymnastic location. Unlike Google Map only shows the result within a small region, this map provides all the gymnastics and fitness centers located in Western Vancouver. For the styling of the map, I did not set the icon that represents gyms too big because some gyms and fitness centers are close by. I set the color of the building to black, it would help to emphasize from background environment and help the reader get a sense of the relationship between neighborhood and location of gymnastics.  However, the buildings only appears after zooming in to a relatively large scale. 

I believe that I use the knowledge of Iconography well, the icon is straight forward presenting the object. The elements included in the map are enough. Not too detailed makes the map messy. The color that present different elements are constant. One component that I did not think about earlier is that the map was designed for web users, did not consider the convenience for mobile users. One potential way to improve this map is to categorize all the locations. Using different icons to present different types of rooms. For example, differentiate gymnastics and fitness centers. Gymnastics tends to provide more weight training types of equipment whereas fitness centers have more cardio training machines. Some of the places are only required member fees, whereas other places require working with a personal trainer. One piece of advice that my peer provided to me is to combine the data of populations distribution. Since the gym and fitness centers are more located in northern parts of Vancouver, it might be interesting to discover whether there is a relationship between population density and the location.
